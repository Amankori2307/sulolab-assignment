## `REQUIREMENTS`
Make sure you read the whole document carefully and follow the guidelines in it.
### `Preface`:
- Write an API that provides a REST interface for the following business requirements: 

### `Functionality`:
- A user should be able to request a booking for a cab from pickup location A to pickup location B 
- A user should be able to view his past bookings

- Middleware for proper http error statuses 
- Sequelize 
- DB migrations and seed scripts 
- Rate limited APIs 
- Authentication middleware 
- Swagger documentation 
- Paginated APIs
### `Requirements:`
- Write clear documentation on how it's designed and how to run the code.
- Write good in-code comments.
- Write good commit messages.
- An online demo is always welcome.
- Provide proper readme which includes steps to setup the code in any system, API documentation (Postman documentation link is preferred).
- Candidate needs to provide the github link and the candidate has to make his repository private.
### `Tech stack:`
- Use Node.js and any framework.
- Use any DB. NoSQL DB is preferred.
### `Bonus Points:`
- If you are familiar with ES6 standards then it will be a bonus point for you.
- If you follow the good practices of the Node js for coding standard/folder structure then it would be considered as a bonus point.
### `What We Care About`
Feel free to use any open-source library as you see fit, but remember that we are evaluating your coding skills and problem solving skills.

Here's what you should aim for:
- Good use of current Node.js & API design best practices.
